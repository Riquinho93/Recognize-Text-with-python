 ## Recognize Text with Python
 
 ### Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
 
 Optical Character Recognition is the electronic or mechanical conversion of images of 
typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text, whether from a
scanned document, aphoto of a document, a scene-photo or from subtitle text
superimposed on an image.

The first task of OCR is to use a scanner to process the physical form of a document.
After all pages are copied, the OCR software converts the document to a two-color or black and white version.
The scanned image or bitmap is analyzed for light and dark areas, where dark areas are identified as characters that need to be recognized and light areas are
identified as the background.
